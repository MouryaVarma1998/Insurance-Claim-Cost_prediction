# Insurance-Claim-Cost_prediction

This repository contains Python code for performing Tweedie regression and XGBoost analysis on a dataset. Tweedie regression is a statistical method used to model data with a Tweedie distribution, which is suitable for modeling non-negative, right-skewed data, such as insurance claims cost. The code explores and analyzes the dataset, trains a Tweedie regression model and an XGBoost regression model.
